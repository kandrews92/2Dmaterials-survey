\section{\label{sec:introduction} Introduction}
The study of nanomaterials is wide-reaching and overlaps many different disciplines of scientific research, from physics to chemisty, materials science, and biomedical engineering, for example. In the past decade research focusing on two-dimensional materials has rapidly increased compared to previous decades. This swift jump in the amount literature and studies being done on various two-dimensional materials is due to several breakthroughs which occurred in the mid 2000s, the resulting properties of such materials, and their possible and numerous applications which are many sweeping across a wide-range of disciplines both academic and commercial. 
The major breakthrough that spurred the plethera of research and interest that now exists on two-dimensional materials and its uses was isolation of a monolayer of graphene. In 2004 Geim et al. were able to isolate a graphene sheet for the first time \cite{novoselovEtAl2004, novoselovEtAl2005}. Graphite's existence had been known for several centuries prior and was applied in some mechanical settings \cite{nanoscaleReview2011}. However, it was not until 1985 and the discovery of fullerenes ($\mathrm{C}_{60}$) that there was thought to be the possibility of interesting and beneficial properties of this structure and its subsequent derivatives, assuming that it could be synthesized in large quantities \cite{krotoFullerenes1985}
